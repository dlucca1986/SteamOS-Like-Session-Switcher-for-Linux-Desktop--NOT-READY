# PHILOSOPHY:   KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
# REPOSITORY:   https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamMachine-DIY
# PATH:         $HOME/.config/steamos_diy/games.d/game.example.yaml

# --- [ 📘 CONFIGURATION HIERARCHY ] ---
# 1. INHERIT: If a key is commented out (#) or deleted, this game will
#    automatically use the global value from config.yaml.
# 2. OVERRIDE: If a key is defined here, it has HIGHER PRIORITY and
#    completely replaces the global setting for this game only.
# 3. DISABLE: To disable a global setting for THIS game only,
#    set it to empty quotes. Example: GAME_WRAPPER: ""

# --- [ 🚀 HOW TO ACTIVATE ON STEAM ] ---
# 1. Open Steam -> Right Click Game -> Properties
# 2. In 'Launch Options', paste exactly this:
#    sdy %command%
# ---------------------------------------

# --- 1. GAME WRAPPER ---
# Local override. Example: "mangohud gamemoderun"
"GAME_WRAPPER": "mangohud gamemoderun"

# --- 2. EXTRA ARGUMENTS ---
# Appended AFTER the game executable.
"GAME_EXTRA_ARGS": ""

# --- 3. SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ---
# Define variables ONLY for this game.
# IMPORTANT: Maintain exactly 2 spaces of indentation for the keys below!
env_vars:
  # CORRECT: Key and value separated by ": " (Space after colon is MANDATORY)
  "DXVK_HUD": "fps"
  "MANGOHUD_CONFIG": "cpu_temp,gpu_temp,fps"

  # WRONG (EXAMPLES):
  #DXVK_HUD:"fps"     # ERROR: Missing space after colon
  # DXVK_HUD : "fps"  # ERROR: Space before colon
  #   DXVK_HUD: "fps" # ERROR: Too many spaces (indentation)
