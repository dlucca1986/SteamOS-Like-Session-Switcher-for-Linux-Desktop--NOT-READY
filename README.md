> ### "The most robust, hardware-agnostic SteamOS experience for the Arch ecosystem."

## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm Daniele, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

This project has evolved into a professional **System Overlay** designed to faithfully replicate the SteamOS ecosystem. Version 3.1.0 marks a major milestone: transitioning from a script-based approach to a robust, **system-native architecture** driven by `systemd`. 

While the project remains hardware-agnostic by design (supporting both **AMD and Intel**), this new version deepens the integration with the Linux OS core for unprecedented stability.

## ✨ Key Features (Systemd Edition)

* **🔄 Native Session Switching**:
  Transition between **Gamescope** and **KDE Plasma** using the official UI buttons. No login screens, no passwords—just a clean handover managed by `systemd` unit conflicts.

* **🎨 Custom Boot Experience**:
  Includes a **Custom Boot Splash** integration to provide a seamless visual transition from the moment you power on your machine.

* **🧠 Intelligent Hardware Detection**:
  The new launcher automatically detects resolution, refresh rates, and GPU capabilities. It configures itself on the fly, ensuring you reach the UI even on complex multi-monitor setups.

* **⚙️ Centralized Master Config**:
  No more hunting for hidden files. The entire system is now governed by a single, professional configuration file: `/etc/default/steamos-diy`.

* **⚡ Zero-DM Boot (Fast & Lean)**:
  Eliminates SDDM/GDM. The system boots directly into the session via `agetty` autologin on TTY1, significantly reducing boot times and overhead.

* **🚀 SteamOS Compatibility Shims**:
  Includes specialized helpers (`jupiter-biosupdate`, `steamos-update`) that "trick" the Steam UI into thinking it's on official hardware, preventing update errors.

* **🎮 Universal Game Wrapper (sdy)**:
  A powerful injection tool for your games. Add custom prefixes, or extra arguments globally or on a per-game basis.

* **🛠️ SteamMachine-DIY Control Center (sdy companion)**:
  Python-based utility that acts as the brain of the system. It orchestrates hardware configurations, manages the Safe Mode state, and provides a bridge between the system services and the user interface.

## 🛡️ Clean Architecture & Safety

I value your system's integrity. This project follows a "system-safe" philosophy to ensure your Arch Linux installation remains clean and stable:

* **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**: Scripts are isolated in `/usr/local/bin/steamos-helpers/`, keeping your primary `/usr/bin/` clean while satisfying Steam's hardcoded path requirements through symbolic links.
* **Transparent Sudoers**: Security is paramount. A minimal, dedicated policy file is added to `/etc/sudoers.d/steamos-diy`. It grants passwordless execution *only* to the specific scripts required for session switching.
* **Systemd-Driven**: Sessions are managed as proper system services (`steamos-gamemode@.service`), ensuring better logging and process recovery.
* **User-Agnostic**: Everything is built using dynamic UID/User detection. No hardcoded usernames.
* **Wayland-First & DM-Less**: Optimized for direct Wayland execution. By bypassing the Display Manager, we ensure **Gamescope** has exclusive, conflict-free access to the GPU.
* **Full Reversibility**: Every system change, link, and configuration entry is tracked. The included uninstaller can revert your system to its original state at any time.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **GPU**: AMD Radeon (preferred) or Intel Graphics (Mesa drivers).
* **Display Manager**: **None/Disabled** (Direct TTY1 login).
* **Desktop Environment**: KDE Plasma 6.x.
* **Core Software**: `steam`, `gamescope`, `mangohud`, `gamemode`.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Follow these steps to transform your system. The installer will guide you through the process, detect your hardware, and handle all dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamMachine-DIY.git
   ```

2. **Enter the folder**:
   ```
   cd SteamMachine-DIY
   ```
  
3. **Set Permission**:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. **Run the Installer**:
    ```
   sudo ./install.sh

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you wish to revert all changes, I’ve included a dedicated uninstaller. 

It will completely remove all scripts, symbolic links, desktop shortcuts, and the sudoers rule:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
